The title of this blog is shamelessly stolen from Claude Lévi-Strauss's <i>The View from Afar</i>, the third volume of his structural anthropology series. Shamelessly, because my ambition, if necessarily on a smaller scale, is the same as his: to penetrate the inflation of subjectivity made possible by cheap, counterfactual cognition. 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
[S]truralism reintegrates man into nature and [makes] it possible to disregard the subject––that unbearably spoilt child who has occupied the philosophical scence for too long now, and prevented serious research by demanding exclusive attention. (<i>The Naked Man</i>, 687)
</p>

No one practises structuralism anymore and the subject is still with us. This blog is an attempt to look at the mirror and not the image.
